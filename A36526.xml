            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SEEING theſe Epiſtles are now to the World made publique, it is imagined, that I ought to be accountable of my private meaning, chiefly for my own diſcharge, leſt being miſtaken, I fall in hazard of a juſt and univerſal Reprehenſion: for,
<q>

Two Points are eſpecially therefore to be explained: firſt, why I entitle this Work, <hi>England's Heroical Epiſtles;</hi> ſecondly, why I have annexed Notes to every Epistles end. For the firſt, The Title (I hope) carrieth Reaſon in it ſelf; for that the moſt and greateſt Perſons herein, were <hi>Engliſh;</hi> or elſe, that their Loves were obtained in <hi>England.</hi> And though (Heroical) be properly underſtood of Demi-gods, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rents were ſaid to be, the one Coeleſtial, the other Mortal; yet is it alſo transferred to them, who for the greatneſs of Mind come near to Gods. For to be born of a Coeleſtial <hi>Incubus,</hi> is nothing elſe, but

By this mark * in the beginning of every Line, thou art directed to the Annotations for an explanation of what is obſcure.</p>
            <p>Now, though, no doubt, I had need to excuſe other things beſide, yet theſe moſt eſpecially; the reſt I over-paſs, to eſchew tedious recital. If they be as harmeleſly taken, as I mean them I ſhall not laſtly be afraid to believe and acknowledge thee a gentle Reader.</p>

                  <q>Receive theſe Papers from thy wofull Lord.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BAndello,</hi> by whom this Hiſtory was made famous, being an <hi>Italian,</hi> as it is the Peoples cuſtome in that Clime, rather to fail ſometimes in the truth of Circumſtance, then to forgoe the grace of their Conceit: in like manner as the <hi>Grecians;</hi> of whom the Satyriſt,
<q>
                        <l>Et quicquid Graecia mendax</l>

                  <p>Thinking it to be a greater Triall, that a Counteſs ſhould be ſued unto by a King, then by the ſon of a King; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the honour of her Chaſtitie ſhould be the more, hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be generally taken ſo: but as by <hi>Polydore, Fabian,</hi> and <hi>Froiſard</hi> appears, the contrary is true. Yet may <hi>Bandello</hi> be very well excuſed, as being a ſtranger, whoſe errors in the truth of our Hiſtory, are not ſo materiall, that they ſhould need an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective, leſt his Wit ſhould be defrauded of any part of his due, which were not leſs, were every part a Fiction. However, lest
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63467:36"/>
a common error ſhould prevail againſt a truth, theſe Epiſtles are conceived in thoſe Perſons, who were indeed the Actors: To wit, <hi>Edward,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> not ſo much of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plextion, as of the diſmall Battels which he fought in <hi>France,</hi> (in like Senſe as we may ſay, <hi>A black Day,</hi> for ſome Tragicall event, though the Sun ſhine never ſo bright therein.) And <hi>Alice</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who, as it is certain, was beloved of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> ſo it is certain, that many Points now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the received Story, can never hold together with likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſuch inforcement, had it not been ſhaded under the Title of a King.</p>
                  <q>And when thou let'ſt down that tranſparent Lid.</q>
                  <p>Not that the Lid is tranſparent; for no part of the Skin is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent: but for that the Gem which that Cloſure is ſaid to contain, is tranſparent: for otherwiſe, how could the Mind understand by the Eye? Should not the Images ſlide thorow the ſame, and repleniſh the Stage of the Fancy? But this belongs to <hi>Opticks.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> call the Eye-lid <hi>Cilium</hi> (I will not ſay of <hi>Celando</hi>) as the Eye-brow <hi>Supercilium,</hi> and the Hair on the Eye-lids <hi>Palpebra,</hi> perhaps <hi>quòd Palpitet,</hi> all which have their diſtinct and neceſſary vſes.</p>

                  <q>From <hi>Engliſh Edward</hi> to the faireſt fair.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was by nature very Chivalrous, and very Amorous, applying his ſweet and aimable Aſpect to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his wanton Appetite the rather: which was ſo well known to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, who at their interview in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to <hi>Paris,</hi> that as <hi>Comineus</hi> reports, being taken at his word, he notwithstanding brake off the matter, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Dames, with their witty converſation, would detain him longer than ſhould be for his benefit: by which means, <hi>Edward</hi> was diſappointed of his Journey. And albeit Princes, whilſt they live, have nothing in them but what is admirable; yet we need not miſtruſt the flattery of the Court in thoſe times: For certain it is, that his ſhare was excellent; his Hair drew near to a black, making the favour of his Face ſeem more delectable: though the ſmalneſs of his Eyes, full of a ſhining moiſture, as it took away ſome Comelineſs, ſo it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued much ſharpneſs of Underſtanding, and Cruelty mingled together. And indeed, <hi>George Beucanan</hi> (that imperious <hi>Scot</hi>) chargeth him, and other Princes of thoſe Times, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Tyranny; as <hi>Richard</hi> the third manifeſtly did.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Edwards</hi> intemperate deſires, with which he was wholly overcome, how tragically they in his Off-ſpring were puniſhed, is univerſally known. A Mirrour, repreſenting their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, that rather leave their Children what to poſſeſs, than what to imitate.</p>

                     <l>To bring us Cryſtal from the frozen Main?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Alluding to their Opinions, who imagine Crystal to be a kind of Ice; and therefore it is likely, they who come from thoſe frozen parts, ſhould bring great ſtore of that tranſparent Stone, which is thought to be congealed with extream Cold. Whether Cryſtal be Ice, or ſome other liquor, I omit to diſpute; yet by the examples of Amber and Coral, there may be ſuch an induration: for <hi>Solinus</hi> out of <hi>Pliny</hi> mentioneth, That in the Nothern Region a yellow Gelly is taken up out of the Sea at low Tides, which he called <hi>Succinum,</hi> we, Amber; ſo likewiſe, out of the <hi>Liguſtic</hi> Deep, a part of the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi> Sea, a greeniſh Stalk is gathered, which hardened in the Air, comes to be Coral, either white or red. Amber notwithstanding is thought to drop out of Trees; as appears by <hi>Martials</hi> Epigram:
<q>
                        <l>Et latet, &amp; lucet, <hi>Phaetontide</hi> condita gutta,</l>
                        <l>Ut videatur apis nectare clauſa ſuo.</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To behold a Bee incloſed in <hi>Electrum,</hi> is not ſo rare, as that a Boys Throat ſhould be cut with the fall of an Ice-ſicle,

the which Epigram is excellent, the <hi>18. li. 4.</hi> He calls it <hi>Phaetontis Gutta,</hi> becauſe of that Fable which <hi>Ovid</hi> reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, concerning the <hi>Heliades,</hi> or <hi>Phaetons</hi> Siſters, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into thoſe Trees, whoſe Gum is Amber, where Flies alighting, are oftentimes tralucently impriſoned.</p>
